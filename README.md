# ðŸŒŸ My C Programming Practice

This repository contains my practice C programs as I learn the basics of C. These are simple, beginner-friendly programs written to improve my understanding of core C concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Programs So Far

- `array_basic.c` â€“ Basic use of arrays (declaring, accessing, modifying)
- `switch_operations.c` â€“ Performing basic operations (like add, subtract, etc.) using `switch` case

More programs will be added as I continue learning. ðŸš€

## ðŸ›  How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have GCC installed. Then use:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
