#  My C Programming Practice

This repository contains my practice C programs as I learn the basics of C. These are simple, beginner-friendly programs written to improve my understanding of core C concepts.

##  Programs So Far

- `array_basic.c` – Basic use of arrays (declaring, accessing, modifying)
- `switch_operations.c` – Performing basic operations (like add, subtract, etc.) using `switch` case
- `array_max_finder.c` – Takes 10 elements from the user, prints the array, and finds the largest number
- `file_read_write.c` – Demonstrates basic file writing and reading using fprintf and fgets
- `matrix_input_display.c` – Takes input for a 2D matrix from the user and displays it in matrix form
- `temperature_converter.c` – Converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius using a menu-driven loop
- `triangle_check.c` – Checks if three given side lengths can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality rule
- `string_array_print.c` – Prints an array of predefined strings using a loop with tab-separated output
- `structure.c` – Demonstrates usage of a structure with int, char, float, and string fields to store and display student-like data
- `even_odd_check.c` – Takes an integer input and checks whether it is even or odd using the modulo operator
- `student percentage.c` – Takes marks of 4 subjects, calculates the average percentage, and prints the corresponding grade (A, B, C, or Fail)
- `factorial.c` – Calculates factorial of a number entered by the user using a for loop
- `file_word_counter.c` – Reads a text file and counts the total number of words




More programs will be added as I continue learning. 

## 🛠 How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have GCC installed. Then use:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
